iterlist
========

Simple class to have iterable list in PHP.

Implements `Countable`, `Iterator` and `ArrayAccess` interfaces.

In addition, some methods allow you to know whether the current item is the *first*, the *last but one* or *the last*.

You can know if the list is *void* or has *only one item*.

Very simple. Please look at the example file to have a basic idea of this class.
